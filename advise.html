  <p class="intro">
    When I first decided to study music in university I had no idea what I was getting into. It sounds silly but I did not think I would have to sing in front of other people! I assumed I would take lessons and the performance students would be the only ones to sing in masterclass, (what even was masterclass?) I am here to help you have a smoother transition than I had into an arts program starting with the audition process. I want to give you all the tools and tricks that I have learned through my own experiences. Think of me as your secret weapon to nailing your auditions, transitioning into a new music program, or confidently participating in a competition. 

To see my resume, learn more about my professional experiences, or hear samples of my singing you can click <a href="/index.html" class="">here</a> or visit the home page.
