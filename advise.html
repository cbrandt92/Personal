  <p class="intro">
    When I first decided to study music in university I had no idea what 
    I was getting into. It sounds silly but I did not think I would have 
    to sing in front of other people! I assumed I would take lessons and 
    the performance students would be the only ones to sing in masterclass, 
    (what even was masterclass?) I am here to help you have a smoother 
    transition than I had into an arts program starting with the audition
    process. I want to give you all the tools and tricks that I have learned
    through my own experiences. From getting my bachelors degree at Wilfrid 
    Laurier, performing in front of dignitaries in Berlin, to getting my Masters 
    degree in NYC. Think of me as your secret weapon to 
     nailing your auditions, transitioning into a new music program, or 
     confidently participating in a competition. 

To see my resume, learn more about my professional experiences, or hear samples of my singing you can <a href="/index.html" class="">visit my home page.</a>
