          Lyric Soprano <strong>Christine Brandt</strong>
          approaches each new project with passion and determination. Born in
          Kitchener, Ontario, Brandt started her musical education singing with
          the KW Philharmonic Children’s Choir. After 12 years of piano studies,
          Brandt began training in vocal performance at Wilfrid Laurier
          University (Waterloo, Ontario), where she sang with the Maureen
          Forrester Women's Choir in addition to numerous solo projects and
          creative endeavors.

          She received her Bachelor of Music in 2016, with a minor in
          psychology. In 2016, Christine was named runner up in the Kitchener
          Waterloo Chamber Orchestra competition and attended Music Theatre
          Bavaria (MTB) in Oberaudorf, Germany where she worked with Cynthia
          Munzer. In 2017, Christine was a featured soloist with the diplomatic
          choir of Berlin conducted by Barbra Leifer which provided the
          opportunity to perform for German dignitaries and government officials
          at their official Christmas tree lighting ceremony. In 2018, she
          arranged and performed a duet recital “If you can’t say it, sing it!”
