  <p class="intro">
    When I first decided to study music in university, I had no idea what 
    I was getting into. It sounds silly but I did not think I would have 
    to sing in front of other people! I assumed I would take lessons and 
    the performance students would be the only ones to sing in masterclass, 
    (what even was masterclass?) I'm here to help you have a smoother 
    transition than I had into an arts program starting with the audition
    process. I want to give you all the tools and tricks that I have learned
    through my own experiences. From getting my bachelors degree at Wilfrid 
    Laurier, to performing in front of dignitaries in Berlin, and getting my Masters 
    degree in NYC. I have garnered a wealth of knowledge and experience 
    which I'd be happy to share with you. Think of me as your secret weapon to 
     nailing your auditions, transitioning into a new music program, or 
     confidently participating in a competition. 

To see my resume, learn more about my professional experiences, or hear 
samples of my singing you can <a href="/bio.html" class="">visit my bio page.</a>

  confident as well as  excited about showing off what we had been working 
  on. I highly recommend taking the time and working with Christine
